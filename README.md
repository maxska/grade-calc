# gradeCalc
This is a program for calculating your average grade for
courses taken at LinkÃ¶ping University, the way the it's calculated
for exchange studies, at the Faculty of Science and Engineering.

## Note
This is a work in progress, so I can't guarantee that it 
gives correct results. 

## How to use it
I wrote it using the Eclipse IDE. To use it in Eclipse, click 
File > Import projects from file system..., and navigate to and choose
the folder for this repository.
